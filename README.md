## An AI Based System for Crime Detection
Chakravyuh is an AI Based System that analyses CCTV footage in real time and checks for three conditions **simultaneously**. 

## Problem Statement:
India ranks pretty high on the scale when it comes to crime and most of these go unreported and get suppressed. Amidst this high crime rate, criminals often escape unconvicted and victims are not safe from the perpetrators in spite of the presence of CCTV cameras. This is mostly due to the absence of a monitoring person at all times, which is why we let Chakravyuh do the monitoring for us.

The three conditions are:
### 1. Mob Formation:
It checks for the number of people present in a particular area and the relative distances between them. If the distance between them is less than a certain number and their total number crosses a limit, the situation is flagged as "mob formation". 

### 2. Weapons Detection:
It checks for the presence of weapons in the CCTV footage. And if any weapon is detected, the situation is flagged as "weapon detection".

### 3. Violence Detection:
It checks if the people in the footage are involved in any violent activities and if so, the situation is flagged as "violence".
